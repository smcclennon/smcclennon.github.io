Welcome to my blog and public notes repository!

I'm Shiraz, a broadcast engineering degree apprentice ðŸ“¡ by day and a sysadmin & cybersecurity enthusiast by night <i class="fa-solid fa-moon"></i> This website is a platform for me to share some of the cool stuff I work on in my spare time ðŸŽª

### What You'll Find Here
In this corner of the internet, you'll find a variety of content that reflects my interests, including software/hardware projects, practical guides, troubleshooting tips, and curated resources that I've found helpful. I hope you discover something valuable along the way!

### Content Organisation
I've organised my blog using a two-tier [category][categories] structure to help you find exactly what you're looking for:

#### Technical Content Types (Primary Categories)
- [**Guides**][guides]: Step-by-step instructions to help you accomplish specific tasks
- [**Projects**][projects]: Documentation of my software and hardware development work
- [**Reference**][reference]: Handy lookup resources, cheat sheets, and technical information
- [**Solutions**][solutions]: Troubleshooting guides and fixes for common technical problems

#### Technical Domains (Secondary Categories)
- [**Broadcast Engineering**][broadcast-engineering]: TV/Radio technical infrastructure, equipment, and standards
- [**Software Development**][software-development]: Programming projects, code snippets, and development tools
- [**System Administration**][system-administration]: OS management, configuration, and maintenance
- [**Networking**][networking]: Network protocols, configurations, and architecture
- [**Web Tools**][web-tools]: Browser-based utilities and techniques

Each post is categorised by both its content type and the technical domain it belongs to, making it easier to browse related content.

### Connect with Me
In the sidebar, you'll find links to my GitHub, where I share my open source projects and contributions, and my LinkedIn profile, which showcases my professional journey. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to drop me an email - my inbox is checked regularly!

### Discussion
Most posts have a comment and reaction box at the bottom, so don't hesitate to join the conversation.

### Offline Access
This site is a progressive web application, which means that all pages you access are cached and available for offline viewing. If you find something useful and want to come back to it later, you can do so on the same device, regardless of your network connection!

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something that piques your interest! Happy browsing!
