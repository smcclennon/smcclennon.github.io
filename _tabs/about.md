Welcome to my blog and public notes repository!

I'm Shiraz, a broadcast engineering degree apprentice ðŸ“¡ by day and a sysadmin & cybersecurity enthusiast by night ðŸŒ™. This website is a platform for me to share some of the cool stuff I work on in my spare time.

### What You'll Find Here
In this corner of the internet, you'll find a variety of content that reflects my interests, including software/hardware projects, practical guides, troubleshooting tips, and curated resources that I've found helpful. I hope you discover something valuable along the way!

### Connect with Me
In the sidebar, you'll find links to my GitHub, where I share my open source projects and contributions, and my LinkedIn profile, which showcases my professional journey. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to drop me an email - my inbox is checked regularly!

### Discussion
Most posts have a comment and reaction box at the bottom, so don't hesitate to join the conversation.

### Offline Access
This site is a progressive web application, which means that all pages you access are cached and available for offline viewing. If you find something useful and want to come back to it later, you can do so on the same device, regardless of your network connection!

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something that piques your interest! Happy browsing!
