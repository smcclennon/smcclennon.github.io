## About My API

I created a small API for internal use which consists of links to various GitHub API pages for my respective projects. Projects with update support will use this API to get the information they need to update (such as patch notes and a download link).

Information within the API pages may seem to be in a rather haphazard order, and that is because it is. I cannot adjust the order, as this would break the update code on projects using this API.

The API pages will appear to have all information on the same line, separated by spaces. This is due to how GitHub.io displays unformatted html.

### API Format

This is the information that goes on the respective (numbered) line

```
1. Latest release details [URL, Json]
2. Project name [String]
3. Latest release direct download link [URL, Json]
4. 5 latest release details [URL, Json]
```

### Information Use

```
1. Display the latest version [e.g v1.2.3]
2. Update the current project name [backwards compatibility]
3. Download the latest release
4. Display up to 5 previous release patch notes
```

### LTFO's use of the API

```python
updateAttempt = 0
print('Checking for updates...', end='\r')
try:  # Remove previous version if just updated
    proj = options['proj']  # Get the current project name
    with open(f'{proj}.tmp', 'r') as content_file:  # Open the temporary file
        oldFile = str(content_file.read())   # Get the old filename
        # If the old version has the current filename, don't delete
        if oldFile != os.path.basename(__file__):
            os.remove(oldFile)  # Delete the previous version of LTFO
    os.remove(f'{proj}.tmp')
except:
    pass
while updateAttempt < 3:  # Attempt to check for updates 3 times (for unstable connections)
    updateAttempt = updateAttempt+1
    try:  # Try to check for updates
        with urllib.request.urlopen("https://smcclennon.github.io/update/api/1") as url:
            repo = []
            for line in url.readlines():
                repo.append(line.decode().strip())  # Read my API
            apiLatest = repo[0]  # Latest release details
            proj = repo[1]  # Update the project name
            ddl = repo[2]  # Direct download
            apiReleases = repo[3]  # List of patch notes
        with urllib.request.urlopen(apiLatest) as url:
            data = json.loads(url.read().decode())  # Read the GitHub API
            latest = data['tag_name'][1:]
        del data  # Prevent overlapping variable data
        release = json.loads(urllib.request.urlopen(
            apiReleases).read().decode())
        releases = [  # Gather (up to) 5 *new* patch notes
            (data['tag_name'], data['body'])
            for data in release
            if data['tag_name'][1:] > ver][::-1]  # [1:] removes "v" from "v1.2.3"
        updateAttempt = 3
    except:
        latest = '0'  # If checking for updates fails, set the latest version to 0

if latest > ver:
    print('Update available!      ')
    print(f'Latest Version: v{latest}\n')
    for release in releases:
        print(f'{release[0]}:\n{release[1]}\n')  # Print patch notes
    confirm = input(str('Update now? [Y/n] ')).upper()
    if confirm == '' or confirm == 'Y':
        latestFilename = f'{proj} v{latest}.py'
        # Download latest version to cwd
        print(f'Downloading "{latestFilename}"...')
        urllib.request.urlretrieve(ddl, latestFilename)
        # Write the current filename to LTFO.tmp
        f = open(f'{proj}.tmp', 'w')
        f.write(str(os.path.basename(__file__)))  # Write the current file name to a temporary file
        f.close()
        os.system(f'"{latestFilename}"')  # Open latest version in the current console window
