## About [Primer](https://github.com/smcclennon/Primer)

On the 25th of November 2019 I was watching a [video](https://youtu.be/VYech-c5Dic) about the importance of prime numbers for encryption. This spiked my interest, and after learning how critical prime numbers are for the world we live in, I really wanted to start generating my own.

The intention wasn't to find the next biggest prime number, Python is definitely the wrong language to use for that purpose, but instead just to see if I could continuously generate prime numbers, store them all to a file, and continue where I left off next time I start the script.

I immediately made a head start on getting the basic generation working, and the following morning created a GitHub repository for the project and pushed what I had [created so far](https://github.com/smcclennon/Primer/blob/2c5ffa0f089ce3b70c6637a449532903cf3d288a/Primer.py).

It's non-destructive nature suprised my teachers, and they were all rather impressed how Primer performed and the statistics it provided.

## So, what can it do?

Primer is a portable prime number generator which can pickup where you left off on any OS you run it on.

## Features

*   Automatic Updates
*   Cross-compatible with Windows & Unix
*   Generate prime numbers
*   Save prime numbers as plain text to Primer.txt
*   Save generation statistics such as total calculations & number of primes found to Primer\_config.json

### Installation

Download the latest release directly onto the target machine, or run on a USB.

### Requirements
