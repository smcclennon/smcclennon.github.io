    <h1 id="header-1">About myself</h2>
    <p>Hi. My name is Shiraz McClennon, and I'm a computer science student with an interest in cyber security.</p>
    <p>I enjoy programming in my free time, and have used a few different languages over the years, some I'm far more experienced in than others.
    </p>

    <h2 id="header-2">My experience</h2>
    <p>My favourite language is Python, but I'm also experimenting with Java. In late 2018, my interest lead me to delve into C++  which went no further than <code class="highlighter-rouge">std::cout << "Hello, World!";</code> as at the time I did not need such a low-level programming language to pursue my projects which is why I haven't included it here.</p>

    <h3 id="header-3">National Cyber Security Centre late 2019</h3>
    <p>Awesome. I was able to talk to professionals about web-request headers, the differences between authentication and authorization, and even had a lecture from an ethical hacker.
    He spoke to us about how he has broken into various banks, both physically and digitally.
    Also under discussion was the use of phishing and the most common passwords, ironically including '123456' and 'password'.</p>

    <h3 id="header-3">Cyber Discovery late 2018</h3>
    <p>I was advised to join Cyber Discovery, the Government funded extracurricular programme for students aged 13-18. ~50% of the CyberStart Game module was completed during the late 2018 intake. My favourite task in this programme was to SSH into Linux servers and extract various hidden information within them.</p>
