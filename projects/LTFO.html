          <p>LTFO was originally called Logout Reminder. I created the python script in early 2019, simply due to the scary amount of students leaving their sessions logged in on the college computers. Logout Reminder's goal was to not only remind said students to logout, but make sure they wouldn't forget.</p>
          <p>I achieved this by creating a script that would generate a READ_ME.txt file in all folders on their student partition of the college server (which had its own drive letter).</p>
          <p>The READ_ME.txt files would have a random number in their filename so that removing the files was easier. The files would contain a message along the lines of:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>You forgot to logout!</p>
            <p>Removal instructions: Search 'READ_ME#374.txt' in the root of your drive, select all, and delete.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The script had no options whatsoever. You would simply run it from a USB on the logged in session, it would generate the files, and then it would close.</p>
          <p>A friend had asked to have a copy of the script, but the computer it was on had corrupt RAM and I had no way to get the script off of the hard drive. The following Saturday, I rewrote the entire thing.</p>
