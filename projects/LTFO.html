<h2 id="about">About LTFO</h2>

<p><div style="display: inline;">
  LTFO was originally named <div class="highlight"><span onclick="toggleDiv('logRem-logo')"
    >Logout Reminder</span></div>. I created the python script in
  early 2019, simply due to the majority of students leaving their sessions
  logged in on the college computers. Logout Reminder's goal was to not only
  remind the said students to logout, but make sure they wouldn't forget.
</div></p>
<div class="spoiler" id="logRem-logo" style=" padding: 0%;">
<pre><code> _                             _     _____                _           _
| |                           | |   |  __ \              (_)         | |

              __/ |
             |___/</code></pre></div>
<p>
  I achieved this by creating a script that would generate a READ_ME.txt file in
  all folders on their student partition of the college server (which had its
  own drive letter).
</p>
<p>
  The READ_ME.txt files would have a random number in their filename so that
  removing the files was safe. The files would contain a message along the lines
  of:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You forgot to logout!</p>
  <p>
    Removal instructions: Search 'READ_ME#374.txt' in the root of your drive,
    select all, and delete.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The script had no options whatsoever. You would simply run it from a USB on
  the logged in session; it would generate the files, and then it would close.
</p>
<p>
  A friend had asked to have a copy of the script, but the computer it was on
  had corrupt RAM. Because of this, I had no way to get the script off of the
  hard drive. The following Saturday, I rewrote the entire script.
</p>
<p>
  The new rewrite of the script included many new features not present in the
  original version including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Ability to select a drive to flood with files (originally hard-coded within
    the script)
  </li>
  <li>Ability to go back and forth between menus</li>
  <li>Final randomly-generated confirmation code to reduce accidents</li>
  <li>Generating an automatic removal script [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/smcclennon/LTFO/releases/tag/build-3">Build 3</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/smcclennon/LTFO/releases/tag/v2.1.2">v2.1.2</a>]</li>
  <li>Automatically check for updates [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/smcclennon/LTFO/releases/tag/v2.1.0">v2.1.0</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/smcclennon/LTFO/releases/tag/v2.1.3">v2.1.3</a>]</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="name-change">The name change</h3>
<p><div style="display: inline;">
  Logout Reminder's project name was changed to
  <div class="highlight"><span onclick="toggleDiv('ltfo-logo')"
    >LTFO</span></div>
  [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/smcclennon/LTFO/releases/tag/v3.0.0">v3.0.0</a>] with inspiration from
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/leoriviera">Louis Riviera</a>
  on GitHub, who also contributed to the LTFO project by helping me learn about
  dictionaries, f-strings, and removing global variables from the code
  altogether.

<p>
  It was at this point that that LTFO began to recieve many new features
  including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Using my <a href="../update/api/index.html">internal API</a> [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/smcclennon/LTFO/releases/tag/v3.0.1">v3.0.1</a> - <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/smcclennon/LTFO/releases/tag/v3.0.2">v3.0.2</a>]
    <div class="highlight">
      <span onclick="toggleDiv('lm-api')">[Learn more]</span>
    </div>
    <div class="spoiler" id="lm-api">
      When changing Logout Reminder's project name to LTFO, I encountered a
      serious backwards compatibility issue where the update code in Logout
      Reminder would fail to update to LTFO<br />This was why I created my
      <a href="../update/api/index.html">API</a>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    Custom messages completely replaced the contents of the flooded files
    [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/smcclennon/LTFO/releases/tag/v4.0.0">v4.0.0</a>]
    <div class="highlight">
      <span onclick="toggleDiv('lm-cMsg')">[Learn more]</span>
    </div>
    <div class="spoiler" id="lm-cMsg">
      <p>Prior to v4.0.0, LTFO has treated custom messages as so:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>You forgot to logout!</p>
        <p>
          Custom message:<br />
          This is an example of a custom message!
        </p>
        <p>
          Removal instructions: Search 'READ_ME#374.txt' in the root of your
          drive, select all, and delete.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>With v4.0.0, LTFO treated custom messages as so:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>This is an example of a custom message!</p>

  <li>
    Introduced {variables} for all message types [<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/smcclennon/LTFO/releases/tag/v4.0.0">v4.0.0</a>]
    <div class="highlight">
      <span onclick="toggleDiv('lm-vars')">[Learn more]</span>
    </div>
    <div class="spoiler" id="lm-vars">
      <p>
        Variables allowed for powerful automation with LTFO such as including
        the time, date, computer name and even the logged in username. These
        variables would allow for messages like this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>{username}, you forgot to logout of {computer} at {time} - {date}</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Dave, you forgot to logout of Computer-3 at 11:36 - 23.11.19</p>
      </blockquote>
