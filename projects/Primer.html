<h2 id="about">About Primer</h2>
<p>
  On the 25th of November 2019 I was watching a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/VYech-c5Dic">video</a> about the importance of prime numbers for encryption. This spiked my interest, and after learning how critical prime numbers are for the world we live in, I really wanted to start generating my own.
</p>
<p>
  The intention wasn't to find the next biggest prime number, Python is definitely the wrong language to use for that purpose, but instead just to see if I could continuously generate prime numbers, store them all to a file, and continue where I left off next time I start the script.
</p>
<p>
  I immediately made a head start on getting the basic generation working, and the following morning created a GitHub repository for the project and pushed what I had <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/smcclennon/Primer/blob/2c5ffa0f089ce3b70c6637a449532903cf3d288a/Primer.py">created so far</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It's non-destructive nature suprised my teachers, and they were all rather impressed how Primer performed and the statistics it provided.
</p>
