<h2 id="about">About SMN</h2>
<p>
  SMN was originally called AIO-AL (All In One - Automatic Logger), quite the
  mouthful, I know. I created this script in late 2018, due to my curiosity
  about my college's computer hardware and internal network connections.
  AIO-AL's goal was to log computer information and hardware into an organised
  folder with appropriate filenames (computer names), and was to do the same
  with network logs.
</p>
<p>
  Creating this script in python was my first experience with file handling. I
  used os-commands to generate information into temporary files, which AIO-AL
  would then append into the log file.
</p>
<p>
  The script was portable, and I gathered information about the different types
  of computers in my college by running AIO-AL via a USB. The organised log
  files split into two folders, computer information & network logs made it easy
  to compare information between computers. I learnt a great deal about the
  computers such as how much RAM they had, which network cards they had
  installed (both physical and virtual), their domain, logon server, and OS
  version.

<h3 id="name-change">The name change</h3>
<p>
  AIO-AL's project name was changed to SMN shortly after
  <a href="LTFO">LTFO</a>'s name was changed.
