# About Myself {#about}
Hi, my name is Shiraz McClennon. I'm studying A level computer science, and have a particular interest in cyber security.

I enjoy programming, and have used several languages over the past few years, both interpreted and compiled.

## Qualifications
- [Palo Alto Networks Cybersecurity Foundation](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/services/education/academy)
- [Cisco Introduction to Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer/introduction-packet-tracer)
- GCSE: English Language, English Literature, Mathematics, Computer Science, Electronics, Media, Combined Sci
- BTEC: IT (Level 2)

## My Experience {#experience}
My favourite language is Python due to how quickly it can get things done.

However in 2020, I ported one of my [python projects](https://github.com/smcclennon/Primer) over to C++ for the performance benefits of the language. This significantly increased my knowledge and understanding of C++.

|Language|Experience|Abilities|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Python|2017-2021|File handling, make web requests, download files, working with [arrays] & {dictionaries}, f'{.format(**variables)}', edit Word documents, integrate Windows OS features, and much more|
|C++|2020|File handling, working with json & variables, OS specific features, cross-platform code, porting code from python, and more|
|Java|2019|System.out.println("Hello World!");, and variable management|
|Windows Scripting (.bat)|2015-2018|Initial coding experience. Driver management with devcon, echo file >> management, set /a %variable% management and custom troubleshooting.|

### Cisco Work Experience (2020) {#cisco-wex}
I absolutely loved it. It was a little different this year, as it was done virtually, so unfortunately I was unable to visit the Cisco offices. However, the experience was still very enjoyable and insightful.

The work experience was for a week, Monday to Friday, 9 to 5. It was rather challenging at times if I'm honest.
The lectures were attended interactively via [Cisco WebEx](https://www.webex.com/). One of the most interesting features of the work placement was the students being required to prepare a presentation by the end of the week of an innovative product, presented to the Dragons. The students were given the creative opportunity to annotate lecture slides and participate in polls, as well as discuss certain topics such as ethics with our group.

<div id="cisco-wex-detail" markdown="1" style="display: none">

The students were given a 1 hour slot to work on their presentations (per day). Due to my computing and leadership skills, I was quickly nominated as the leader for my group. As the work experience was virtual, my IT knowledge was an advantage for organising and collaborating on this with my team. My team quickly realised that we needed more time to work on the project outside of the allocated 1 hour, and therefore to facilitate this, I got permission from the Cisco work experience organisers, and created a [Discord](https://discord.com/) server which allowed us to collaborate on it in our free time.

After discussing the product brief for our presentation, we spent two days planning it. I then assigned research roles to each team member so we could all independantly complete our respective, detailed but concise powerpoint slides.

As the project manager, I went through each slide to taper down the information in order to conform to the 5 minute presentation time limit. To manage everyones anxiety, after a couple of dry-runs, I suggested my team members relax for the half hour proceeding the Dragons.

It was a success... even though we ran over the 5 minute limit.

### Hacktoberfest (2020) {#hf20}
This year, there was a noticable improvement from last year. DigitalOcean resolved an issue where regular commits counting as pull requests. This year, the repository you were contributing to also had to have the `hacktoberfest` label, or your pull request would not count towards Hacktoberfest.

Unlike last year, this year I was prepared. I had pre-planned which of [my projects](projects) I would work on in order to complete Hacktoberfest, which I did with **10** verified pull requests.

### Hacktoberfest (2019) {#hf19}
I joined [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) on the 26th of September 2019 after hearing people discuss it in college. It was quickly forgotten about as I continued to focus on the development of [LTFO](projects/LTFO). A month later, an email was received stating that I had (unknowingly) completed the event with **9** verified pull requests.

### National Cyber Security Centre (2019) {#ncsc}
Awesome. I was able to talk to professionals about web-request headers, the differences between authentication and authorization, and even had a lecture from an ethical hacker.
He spoke to us about how he has broken into various banks, both physically and digitally.
Also under discussion was the use of phishing and the most common passwords, ironically including '123456' and 'password'.

### Cyber Discovery (2018) {#cd18}
I was advised to join Cyber Discovery, the Government funded extracurricular programme for students aged 13-18. ~50% of the CyberStart Game module was completed during the late 2018 intake. My favourite task in this programme was to SSH into Linux servers and extract various hidden information within them.
