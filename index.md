# About Myself {#about}
Hi, my name is Shiraz McClennon, and I'm a computer science student passionate about cyber security.

I enjoy programming, and have used a few different languages over the past few years, both interpreted and compiled.

I enjoy programming in my free time, and have used a few different languages over the years, some I'm far more experienced in than others.

## My Experience {#experience}

My favourite language is Python, but I'm also experimenting with Java. In late 2018, my interest lead me to delve into C++ which went no further than `std::cout << "Hello, World!";` as at the time I did not need such a low-level programming language to pursue my projects.

However, on the 5th May 2020, I spent two days porting my python script [Primer](https://github.com/smcclennon/Primer) to C++, which significantly increadsed my knowledge and understanding of the language.

|Language|Experience|Abilities|
|:-|:-|:-|
|C++|2020|File handling, working with json & variables, OS specific features, cross-platform code, porting code from python, and more|
|Python|2017-2020|File handling, make web requests, download files, working with [arrays] & {dictionaries}, f'{.format(**variables)}', edit Word documents, integrate Windows OS features, and much more|
|Java|2019|System.out.println("Hello World!");, and variable management|
|Windows Scripting (.bat)|2015-2018|Initial coding experience. Driver management with devcon, echo file >> management, set /a %variable% management and custom troubleshooting.|



### Hacktoberfest (2019) {#hf19}
I joined [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) on the 26th of September 2019 after hearing people discuss it in college. It was quickly forgotten about as I continued to focus on the development of [LTFO](projects/LTFO). A month later, an email was received stating that I had (unknowingly) completed the event with **9** verified pull requests.

### National Cyber Security Centre (2019) {#ncsc}
Awesome. I was able to talk to professionals about web-request headers, the differences between authentication and authorization, and even had a lecture from an ethical hacker.
He spoke to us about how he has broken into various banks, both physically and digitally.
Also under discussion was the use of phishing and the most common passwords, ironically including '123456' and 'password'.

### Cyber Discovery (2018) {#cd18}
I was advised to join Cyber Discovery, the Government funded extracurricular programme for students aged 13-18. ~50% of the CyberStart Game module was completed during the late 2018 intake. My favourite task in this programme was to SSH into Linux servers and extract various hidden information within them.
